* plants could "tap" water seeds.. they could dry up?
* flowers of different (random) colors? behave like weeds?
  * maybe plant in rows?
* update all create_actor calls to go through the planter
* add critters? use polaris pathfinding? they have requirements for randomly spawning
  * squirrels like trees
  * bees like flowers, etc
  * would NOT use seed_view (they will require sub "pixel" rendering
* add clouds that slowly flow over the screen and the cursor disperses them?
